# Feedback

Congrats on satisfying the project requirements! Here's some feedback for you:

## Code Quality

Is the code well formatted? Are variable and function names semantic and sensible? Is the code easy to read and understand?

- Code is generally well-formatted, well-named, and contains few style / quality issues. Also, make sure to remove any unused code (e.g., console.log) from your HTML/JS/CSS files! Also remove the empty `script.js` file from the root directory.

## Technical Requirements

How does the project stack up to the requirements for this project? Is the developer making use of the material we've covered in a way that makes sense?

- Your game separates concerns into distinct HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files. I was impressed that you took time to refactor your code!

## Creativity and Interface

Is the application easy to navigate? Does it work well in every major browser? Is it responsive? Does it incorporate modern UI Themes?

- Your game renders in the browser with no major errors. As a next step, consider making your game responsive!

## Functionality

Does the application work without errors or bugs? Does it present a complete app, where every feature is fully implemented in a way that makes sense?

- The application works without errors or bugs.
- Make sure to validate your HTML files with the HTML validator!

## Presentation

Is there adequate documentation? Is the repository well organized and free of clutter?

- Your readme contains relevant information about the application. To make it even more informative, consider adding the live url for your game and other sections such as wireframes and installation instructions. See these examples: https://github.com/esin87/travelogue or https://github.com/esin87/StarTrek_TNG_Trivia_Game
- Also take a look at some of the formatting changes I made to your readme.
